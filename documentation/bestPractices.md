# Best Practices #
## Agents ##

### Manifests ###

What goes in the servicing and discovery manifests

## Floor ## 

Should it be best to implement it locally?

You could ask the Floor to find a Convener


## Convener ## 

Probably should have some intelligence, but we don't specify how the intelligence works. Could be an LLM or even simpler. 

what does the Convener manifest look like? Could be in the capabilities 
Maybe the Discovery agent could ask for it

Only one agent can have the role of the Convener at one time in a conversation

## Security ## 

## Sentinels ## 

What is a sentinel? 

## Discovery ## 

Discovery should be implemented as an agent, for example, the rolodex should be implemented as a Discovery Agent

# Out of Scope #
Use of LLMs, especially particular LLM
